<h1>Different Varieties Of Anxiety </h1>
<h2> How Do You Handle Your Anxiety? </h2>
<p>Personal Opinion: Anxiety for me is a feeling of sickness, my fears/something I'm indecisively overthinking being forcefully brought out uncontrollably. I also used to feel like anxiety is something that you can never get rid of. <p>

<p>Please Note: Some of the things listed in "how to handle anxiety" are coming from personal experience and research, noting that everyone is different and that some ways may not help with your anxiety, it truly depends..</p>
<p>here are some ways you can handle your anxiety:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Maturing out of it/ accepting the fact that it's now something apart of you and finding things that make you calm or brings you to happiness/ getting to know your anxiety</li>
        <br>
        <li> Try to catch your breathing, breath slowly to calm yourself down</li>
        <br>
        <li>Take yourself to a quite place/ listening to soothing vibrational music is very relaxing</li>
        <br>
        <li>NEVER LET YOUR ANXIETY DICTATE OR LIMIT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, try taking small acts of bravery at times</li>
    </ol>
